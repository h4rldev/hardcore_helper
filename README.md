> This project is my first Java project ever, and maybe or maybe not my last, excuse terrible code.

A quilt mod that checks if a person has died, gives a countdown, marks the world for deletion, then closes the server. (Has world saving functionality through a command)

Requires supporting script for full functionality (will be embedded in this repo at a later date!)
