# Hardcore Helper

> \[!NOTE\]
> This project is my first Java project ever, and maybe or maybe not my last, excuse terrible code.

A quilt mod that checks if a person has died, gives a countdown, marks the world for deletion, then closes the server. (Has world saving functionality through a command)

Requires supporting daemon to delete world and restart server, will work on this next.
